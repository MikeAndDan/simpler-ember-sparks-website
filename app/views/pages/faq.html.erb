  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h3>What do I get when I subscribe?</h3>
  <p>You get access to dozens of Pro screencasts, as well as a warm fuzzy feeling inside for helping the community.</p>
  <h3>How do I unsubscribe?</h3>
  <p>You go to <%= link_to 'your account page', account_path %> and hit the unsubscribe button.  You will be unsubscribed immediately and your credit card will no longer be charged.</p>
  <h3>Can you cover subject X?</h3>
  <p>Demand plays a role in how I decide screencast topics.  <a href="mailto:jeffrey@emberscreencasts.com">Email me</a> to make your voice heard.</p>
  <h3>How do I get started with Ember?</h3>
  <p>Some great getting-started guides are <a href="https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101">ember-cli 101</a>, <a href="https://embergrep.com/">Ember Grep</a>, and <a href="http://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs/">Rock and Roll with EmberJS</a>.</p>
  <p>Once you're done with one of these books you should be ready to learn from the Basic screencasts and some of the Intermediate screencasts here.
  <p>I'm also working on a more unusual introductory book that will complement the approaches taken in the three resources above.  Stay tuned.</p>
  <h3>Can you teach me/my team/my employees <em>personally</em>?</h3>
  <p>Contact me at <a href="mailto:bilesjeffrey@gmail.com">my personal email address</a> to discuss corporate training.</p>
